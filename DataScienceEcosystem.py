# # Data Science Tools and Ecosystem

# In this notebook, Data Science Tools and Ecosystem are summarized.

# **Objectives:**
# - List of popular languages for Data Science
# - List of common libraries for Data Science
# - Creating tables
# - Evaluating basic arithmetic expressions

# Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:

# 1. Python
# 2. R
# 3. SQL

# Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:
# 1. Pandas
# 2. Matplotlib
# 3. NumPy
# 4. Pytorch
# 5. Ggplot

# Data Science Tools|

# ### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python.

# This is a simple arithmetic expression to multiply then add integers.

# In[10]:


exp = int((3*4) + 5)
print(exp)


# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by dividing by 60.

# In[9]:


min = 200
hours = float(min/60)
print(hours)
